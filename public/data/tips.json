Like the railway in India, waterways are the lifeblood of Bangladesh; from Dhaka the beating heart, veins snake out all over the country. And in much the same way that no trip to India is complete without a journey by train, a trip to Bangladesh calls for a journey by river. And sure enough, I ended up on a lot of different boats on my travels in this pretty little green country. A bamboo mat on a rowboat drifting on skinny channels in a mangrove swamp:"

I could ramble on about the country’s infinite serene waterways, rich Bengali cuisine, or vibrant tropical landscapes, but they’re trivial in the grand scheme of things—people are Bangladesh’s best asset. Bangladeshis are some of the most hospitable people on earth. Their endless curiosity and willingness to help a foreign guest never ceases to amaze. Your time traveling in Bangladesh will be full of invitations for tea, requests to dine at people’s homes, and conversations both simple and deep about your respective countries. In my opinion, the people are the only reason you need to visit Bangladesh."
